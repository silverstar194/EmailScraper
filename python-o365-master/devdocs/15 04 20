Getting tonsilitous doesn't help with development.

I've gotten O365 uploaded to PyPi and to my suprise in 10 days there have been 246 downloads! Awesome! But this means I need to work out a lot of the problems. 

I've got a lot of proper work setup on github as well. Milestones and issues and such to help me keep track of what I'm trying to do. It's going along quite nicely.
